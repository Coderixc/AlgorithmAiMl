Quantitative Stock Market Modeling with AI & Machine Learning

Welcome to our comprehensive AI-driven project focused on quantitative modeling for the stock market. This repository contains robust implementations of machine learning algorithms to build predictive models using stock price data (OHLC - Open, High, Low, Close).

🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement machine learning models for stock price analysis and forecasting. By leveraging modern Python libraries and machine learning frameworks, we aim to generate actionable insights from complex market data.

🧠 Key Features

Stock Data Processing: Efficient handling and transformation of OHLC data using our custom distribution class.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of classification and regression models tailored to stock market trends.

Data Handling: Use of NumPy and Pandas for data wrangling.

Statistical Analysis: Insightful analysis using key statistical techniques.

Scalable Framework: Code structure designed for extensibility and scalability.
